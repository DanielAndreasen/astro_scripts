Small tools for an astronomer
=============================

Small scripts to make my life easier.

The tools are mainly (if not exclusive) for spectroscopy. All the small scripts
are fairly well documented, and the python scripts use the module `argparse`
which means you can run them like

    python numpy2moog -h

and get some fancy help information on how to use them. The shell scripts have
a block comment in top of the file.
